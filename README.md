# KMean_UnsupervisedLearning

The data set has information about features of silhouette extracted from the images of different cars
Four "Corgie" model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars.
 This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable,
 but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.
